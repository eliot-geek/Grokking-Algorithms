            • Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.
            • When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
            • With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
            • With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
            • Arrays allow fast reads.
            • Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
            • All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).*/
