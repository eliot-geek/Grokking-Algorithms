In this chapter


• You learn about divide-and-conquer. Sometimes you’ll come across a problem that can’t be solved by any algorithm you’ve learned. When a good algorithmist comes across such a problem, they don’t just give up. They have a toolbox full of techniques they use on the problem, trying to come up with a solution. Divide-and-conquer is the irst general technique you learn.


• You learn about quicksort, an elegant sorting algorithm that’s often used in practice. 
Quicksort uses divide-and-conquer.
