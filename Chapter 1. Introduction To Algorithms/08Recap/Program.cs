            • Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
            • O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
            • Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
            • Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
            • Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.  */
